# vcoco_utils
some utils for vcoco-dataset , help to make a new dataset like vcoco using lableme

- `trains_json.py`:  convert the JSON file annotated by `Labelme` to the GROUD TRUTH file of TEST_VCOCO ,which is called  `new_dataset_test.json`
- `new_vcoco_eval.py`: rewrite the official `vcoco_eval` file of vcoco, mainly changed the `test_vcoco` file to read directly into our own  `test_vcoco`  generated by `trains_json.py`,which is called  `new_dataset_test.json`
- `test.py`: the file for test, output mAP
- `1.json,2.json……`： the labed file  generated by `Labelme`
- `111.json`: generated  by your HOI model  in your own dataset
